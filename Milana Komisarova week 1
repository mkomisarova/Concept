This week I worked together with Andreea. Our goal was to figure out the design of our website, we decided how itâ€™s going to look and drew an approximate sketch. We decided on the colors that are going to be used, the location of all functionalities that we are going to implement, and got approval from our teammates. We also decided in which platform are we going to work and tested it out.
